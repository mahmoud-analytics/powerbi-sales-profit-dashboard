📈 Sales & Profit Dashboard (Power BI)
This project is an interactive Sales & Profit Dashboard built using Microsoft Power BI, designed to analyze sales performance, customer data, and profitability metrics in a clear, business-oriented way.
The main focus of this dashboard is to transform transactional retail data into actionable insights that support strategic decision-making.
📊 Dashboard Overview
The dashboard is logically divided into several key analytical sections:
1. Performance Summary
Total Sales: $20 Million
Total Profit: $9.92 Million
Total Quantity: 1 Million units
Top State Sales: California
Sales Trends: Analysis of performance over time (monthly/quarterly/yearly).
2. Geographic Analysis
Patient distribution by age group
Visualization of sales performance across U.S. states (CA, OR, WA, NV, AK) using treemaps and map visuals.
3. Product & Customer Insights
Analysis of sales by Buying Package category.
Detailed table of stock items and performance metrics.
Filtering capabilities by Employee, City, and Customer Buying Group.
🎯 Key Insights
Regional Performance: California is the highest-contributing state to overall sales.
Profit Drivers: Specific product lines and buying packages contribute disproportionately to total profit.
Sales Ranges: Identification of high-value customers and specific sales order ranges (e.g., between $10 and $1000).
🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Power BI: The primary platform for data visualization and reporting.
Power Query (M): Used for data ingestion and transformation.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For complex calculations and custom measures within the data model.
Data Modeling: Implementation of a robust Star Schema.
📁 Data Model & Dataset
The project uses a clean Star Schema data model (visible in the second image provided previously) with a central FactSale table linked to several dimensions (DimStockItem, DimCustomers, DimCity, DimEmployee, DimDate, Dim Measures).
(Note: The dataset used in this project is simulated and intended for demonstration purposes only. It does not represent real-world corporate data.)
🚀 Purpose of the Project
Practice real-world business intelligence scenarios.
Improve data modeling and dashboard storytelling skills.
Build a professional Power BI portfolio project.
📌 Notes
The dashboard is optimized for usability and readability.
The project focuses on delivering clear business insights rather than just visual design.
